# paper-writing-materials

`library.bib` contains all papers I used as references. I probably need to classify all papers into different fields.

`acmart.cls` is a tailored Latex style file that headers and footers are all removed. I use this file to compose my submission to ACM conferences. ***Attention***: after acceptance, the style file should be replaced by the style file [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Using this style file for building published work may violate the **copyright law**.
